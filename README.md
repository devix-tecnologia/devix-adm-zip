# @devix/directus-file-zip

This is a temporary fork of the `adm-zip` library. It includes a specific fix for a critical issue that has been addressed while awaiting an official release from the original repository.

Once the official release is available, it's recommended to switch back to the original package.

Original project: [adm-zip](https://github.com/cthackers/adm-zip)
